## Introduction
This collection of tutorials are based on my learnings from client projects. For each topic I will show you how to identify, implement and evaluate performance techniques that can improve your site's load time.

## Benefits

- You likely use it every day at work.
- This makes it possible to practice and apply your acquired knowledge each day on real world programs rather than pet projects.
- Be able to show clients the value of the improvement based on the results of each section.

## Testing platform
