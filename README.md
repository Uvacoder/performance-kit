## Introduction
This collection of tutorials are based from my learnings from client projects. I will talk about what each topic is, how to implement it and then we will see the value it has made on the website.

## Benefits

- You likely use it every day at work.
- This makes it possible to practice and apply your acquired knowledge each day on real world programs rather than pet projects.
- Be able to show clients the value of the improvement based on the results of each section.

## Testing platform

When testing on web page test run the tests at these settings to get simlliar results to mine. If you wish to compare changes then you can compare them [here](http://performance-kit.surge.sh/).

> Dulles, VA - Moto E - Chrome - 3G

## Plans for the future
